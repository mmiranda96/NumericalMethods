# TC2019: Numerical Methods

## Description
Repository for the class of numerical methods. This repository includes common numerical methods for solving mathematical problems. Everything is programmed in C++ or Scilab.

Also, each method has a link to a post explaining the method, what is it for, how it works and every other specification.

In order to compile, just run compile.sh. All bin files will be located on bin/.
